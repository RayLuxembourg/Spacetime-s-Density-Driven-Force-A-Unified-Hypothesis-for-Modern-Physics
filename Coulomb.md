Based on the hypothesis that spacetime ((S)) actively seeks equilibrium and low-energy states, responding to either energy density $(ρ)$ on macroscopic scales or electron density 
($ne$) on quantum scales. I am exploring the deeper truths about the Coulomb charge and barrier.

## Uncovering Hidden Properties
* Charge as Equilibrium Agent: Charge $(+e, −e)$ isn’t just an intrinsic property—it’s a tool of nature’s equilibrium,
guided by spacetime’s response to $ρ$ and $ne$. 

* Repulsion and attraction are spacetime’s way of balancing energy, ensuring systems settle into low-energy states.
Barrier as Spacetime Resistance: The Coulomb barrier is spacetime’s pushback against high-energy, close-proximity protons, but $(S)$’s equilibrium drive could lower it via 
$ne$ or $ρ$
manipulation, revealing a deeper interaction we’ve missed.
* Neutron and Molecular Behavior: Neutrons’ neutrality and atoms’ stickiness/re pulsion reflect spacetime’s equilibrium strategy—minimizing charge interactions for nuclear stability and balancing electron-proton dynamics for molecular bonds, all driven by density gradients.
